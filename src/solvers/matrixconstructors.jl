Set small values in a matrix to zero in-place. This enables sparse matrices representation

# Description
This function iterates over the elements of the matrix `M` and sets any value with an absolute magnitude smaller than or equal to the specified tolerance `系` to zero.

# Arguments
- `M`: The matrix to be filtered.
- `系`: The threshold below which elements are set to zero. Default is the machine epsilon for the element type of `M`.

- The filtered matrix `M`, with small values set to zero.
